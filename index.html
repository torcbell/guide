<p>Decentralization seems to imply a kind of internal matrix, like a childrens string game. Connections are drawn from shared space and shared memory. "

You don't want 'content'. You want data with history and evolution. Think cat's cradle.

The game consists of two or more players making a sequence of connections, each altering the previous network. The game begins with one player making the eponymous pattern Cat's Cradle. After each pattern, the next player manipulates that pattern and removes the string pattern from the hands of the previous player with one of a few simple motions and tightens the loop to create another pattern, for example, Diamonds.

One way to collaborate is to show your work.</marquee>

<p>Decentralization requires standardization. Maybe "norm-sending" or "ethics". We can use forking to accumulate attributions in an adaptable context, and establish connections sufficient to trace back to an earlier pattern.</p>

<p>There is always another possible pattern.</p>
<p>Community awareness is keeping information open and up to date.</p>
<p>Digital scarcity is weird. We own our identities as cryptographic property to ensure authorship and attribution.</p> 
<p>Construct > content. Or: Choose Your Own Adventure. Federate content management so that owners (as opposed to users?) can dynamically merge group activity based on how they'd like to limit or extend their participation or pathway through the system.

<p>Fork information that is relevant elsewhere and create contexts, not content.</p>
<p>Publish, then review.</p>
<p>Read a book and notice your experience of it. Do you think authors should be guaranteed to know what comes of their word?</p>
<p>Are conversations the only kind of social media communication we can have? Think about correspondence, long-distance collaboration or communicating across centuries. What othr kinds of online reading and writing can we provoke? </p>

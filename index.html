Forget all the standard career paths. Don’t get an internship, don’t get an MBA, don’t write resumes, don’t go to interviews, don’t get into sex work, drug dealing or dog sitting, and above all, don’t think you’ll get a job out of putting all these together. This idea is nothing more than what politicians always did and you see it today in the up and coming neighborhoods full of promising young brownstowns. The point is to do something that doesn't remotely resemble work. You’ve got to be pretty disciplined about this, and beware of any workplace that caters to its employees. There's no such thing as a free lunch except in cases where you aren't. 

Worldbuid what you see in the real world; worldbuild real places and people rather than from schools. If you stick to school you’ll end up with boring opportunities, since that's a ponzi scheme. Take advantage of existing "programs": a student movement, riot cops, tear gas, the demands, kettling—a natural. Remember when they were passing out bitcoin like candy at Zuccotti park? Don't hesitate to become a storm chaser, scoping out disaster all the way from Smokey Mountain to Standing Rock. You can get a lot done on your iphone. Fuck institutional resources: try a handshake deal. Human connection sells, so does "supporting" "creatives". You can learn a lot from these kinds of interactions. Let someone else take that six-week course on React Native. 

Break up your friend zones. A regular cast is what the sitcoms rely on. You can experiment by gradually widening the socioeconomic horizons between your friends; first on the level of similar interests, then between ages, neighborhoods, time zones, cities, continents. You don’t have to be everywhere at once. You don’t even have to be in a famous American city, let alone Berlin. The places you’re in are as good as the places other participants are in. Learn to recognize that.

Always bootstrap in the same practical way. Not in a pandering way; avoid pitch decks, trade shows, business cards, resumes, fad diets, life coaches, nootropics, social media justice campaigns and so forth. If someone asks you for money, give it to them. There’s plenty more where that came from especially if you live in a large, coastal city on the East or west coasts of the United States. These kinds of places are too expensive to be miserable in. When you want a new project, better to hang around until someone figures an interesting problem, then a more interesting problem. A bunch of artists get kicked out a work co-op— then, a naturally occurring cultural enclave populated with first gen Americans comes to consciousness. The two groups realize they have something in common and start to participate in district politics. A local print shop sympathizes with the cause. And someone donates a lot of computers. 

Break up your time and let it be real time. Real time is found when things are going on in real places. It has nothing to do with the workweek, the unified time of the mobile device. It has even less to do with office hours, happy hours, therapy hour. Whatever happens should happen in its natural time. Suppose you consider how long it’d take to bring a child to term or write a novel. Well if you were on some kind of "track", one of them would have to wait until the other was done. Biological clocks, long term relationships, that’d decide which came first. Of course, you could always marry rich, but unless someone needs citizenship, why bother? Don't let the runway run your life. 


Well suppose these situations made up your program? The collective thing would be easy to do should everyone tap into the wealth of communities, because individuals are broke comparatively. You could spend time tutoring kids without parents, or getting a Depression Garden off the ground. And the seasons of things can help develop the course of the social. The theory of alternating contrasts like night—day, night—action, quiet—action could cause you to arrange the conjuncture of events closely together in the order of premieres, elections, fashion week. But that might be inconvenient, so string them out in whatever way is best for the participants, a financial quarter apart if necessary. 



Since you’re in the world now and not in grad school, you can't afford to be a lousy sport. If your image calls for the president and vice presidents of Chase-Manhattan sitting in their biggest vault and throwing gold coins around like babies, and you can’t get them to do it, then forget it and go on to something else. If you need to cut down lots of timber with chain saws whining and trees cracking, find a guy who needs some woods thinned out anyway. If you want a bulldozer to chew up some ground, . You’ll save yourself a lifetime of debt and might learn something about ground leveling. If you want to work with kids, discover what they really can do and like to instead of giving them something fancy you’d like to do but won’t. Let them build something out of piles of trash, paint up some old cars in a junkyard, dig a huge hole at the beach. If you want to have all your participants start naked, swimming, making love or whatnot, there are times and plenty of places where it wouldn’t stir up any dust. On the other hand, if you like being busted by the cops, you might think of working jail into your personalized degree program.



Work with the power around you, not against it. It makes things much easier, and you’re interested in getting things done. When you need official approval, go out for it. You can use police help, the mayor, the dean of the college you dropped out of, the chamber of commerce, the company exec, venture capitalists, and all your friends. Be your own public relations figure; convince them all that what you’re doing is worthwhile because it’s enjoyable to play, just the same as it’s enjoyable for them to go fishing. Its not a snap, of course, but everyone loves to be manipulated. They just get pissed when you do it poorly. 



When you’ve got something going for you, don’t rehearse what to say when people ask you what you do. This will make it unnatural because it will build in the idea of legitimacy, some institutionally-sanctioned thing that’s mostly in peoples heads. There is nothing to improve in your path, you don’t need to be a professional performer. It’s best when it is artless, for better or worse. If it doesn’t work, you can change the answers you get by shuffling around the languages you use to ask the question. “What do you do?” — “…When?” it’s unnecessary to rehearse situations like staring down the barrel of your thirties, tearing down a public threat, throwing transcripts into a field and watching the rain wash off the ink, driving a bunch of cars off in different directions until they run out of gas. These aren’t perfectible actions. 



Drop out once only. Dropping out of everything just looks like fear of commitment, and not the serious kind of commitment implicated here. You’re not going to improve this move, and it’s going to get harder to get away with the older you get. Imagine trying to get copies of your old transcripts, in order to see the rain wash off those tender grades. Why bother? Give up the whole idea of going viral. A working life is not a show. Leave the shows to the influencers and Jeff Bezos. Bootstrapping is a game with a high, a ritual that no church would want because there’s no religion for sale. Bootstrapping is for those who happen in this world, for those who don’t want to go to grad school and have a certain kind of security, already obsolete. If you want to win, you can’t be outside peeking in. You’ve got to be involved physically. Without a boss, an advisor or a grant, you can be off on the move, using all kinds of environments, mixing in crypto, never worrying about what your high school teachers will think, and you can spread your action all around the globe whenever you want. Professionalism is like college education and drugs: it’s fed to people who have to sit on their butts for longer and longer amounts of time to get the point, and the point is that there’s lots of other stuff to do, which all the smart people prefer to just think about. But serious drop outs have a plan and go ahead and carry it out. To use an old expression, they don’t merely read the room, they transform it.
